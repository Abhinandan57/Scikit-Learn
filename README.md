# Scikit-Learn
- Scikit is a powerful and modern machine learning Python library. It a tool for fully and semi-automated data analysis and information extraction.
- It has efficient tools to identify and organize problems such as whether data fits supervised or unsupervised learning model.
- It contains many free and open datasets.
- It has a rich set of built-in libraries for learning and predicting.
- It provides model support for every problem type.
- It also has built-in functions such as pickle for Model persistence.
- It is supported by a huge open source community and vendor base.  
__Scikit-Learn - Problem Solution Approach:__  
(1) __Model Selection:__ Choosing the model and machine algorithm based on the dataset type.  
(2) __Estimator Object:__ Using the __Estimator__ Object, which represents the model in Scikit-learn, by importing the class and instantiating it.  
(3) __Model Training:__ Fitting the data into the model to train and test it.  
(4) __Predictions:__ Using the __predict__ method to forcast the response of unseen or new dataset.  
(5) __Model Tuning:__ Tunning the model through multiple iterations and result observations .  
(6) __Accuracy:__ Striving for accuracy using built-in methods that supports the predictive model.
